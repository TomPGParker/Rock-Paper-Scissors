Rock-Paper-Scissors
===================

I was given a simple directive in my final assignment for the course Computational Cognative Science, to implement an algorithm we'd covered in class or do some research into a topic that'd been covered. I decided to to use what we'd learnt about patterns to see if it's possible to write an algorithm that will out peform humans in the game Rock-Paper-Scissors.

If you want to test the program yourself, it's designed to be used with two people. The first person is told what move to make against the secound person. The first person then records what the first person did and the program will tell them what to do next time, adapting against what the second person did.
